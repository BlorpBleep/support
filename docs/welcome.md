### How to Get Support

We offer several ways to help you get the assistance you need:

- **Chatbot (Fastest & Most Effective)**  
  Our intelligent chatbot, powered by ChatGPT, is trained using the extensive resources on this website. It knows everything about CicadaVPN and can guide you to the best solution in the most efficient way. Our customers love using the chatbot for its speed and accuracy. We highly recommend trying it first! [Start a chat now](https://cicadavpn.streamlit.app/).

  If you prefer, you can reach out to our support team via email. While not as quick as the chatbot, our team is dedicated to providing you with a great support experience. Expect a helpful response in a timely manner.
