_Last updated: February 15, 2024_

We use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies (collectively referred to as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy) to help provide, protect, and improve our services and Websites. This Cookie Policy applies to www.cicadavpn.com.

This Cookie Policy supplements our Privacy Policy and explains what cookies are, how and why we use them, the types of cookies we use, and how you can manage your cookie preferences.

The capitalized words used in this Cookie Policy are defined here or in our Privacy Policy, and/or our General Terms.

## What are cookies?

In this Cookie Policy, we use the term “cookies” to collectively refer to cookies, pixels, beacons, and related technologies. These small text files are discreetly placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or any other) when you visit Websites. Their functionality is diverse, for example, serving to enhance Websites' performance, measure marketing effectiveness, provide unique identification to your web browser, and store settings within it. Also, cookies ensure the delivery of essential communications.

You can learn more about the types of cookies and their functions on various independent information websites, for example, [https://knowcookies.com/](https://knowcookies.com/) or [https://allaboutcookies.org/](https://allaboutcookies.org/).

## What types of cookies do we use and why?

Cookies can be classified in different ways, such as by the company that manages them (cookie origin), the time they remain active (cookie duration), or their purpose.

Understanding these categories is important for managing your preferences regarding the use of cookies and enhancing your user experience. Below are descriptions of the cookie categories used on our Websites.

### By cookie origin:

- **First-party cookies:** These are cookies set directly by us (i.e., our Websites) on users' devices.
- **Third-party cookies:** These cookies are set on users' devices by third-party services integrated into our Websites, such as analytics or advertising platforms. For example, if you access our Websites through a partner's link or interact with embedded content on our Websites, specific cookies help gather data about these interactions. This data can be necessary for enhancing your user experience or providing partner-specific offers.

### By cookie duration:

- **Session cookies:** Temporary cookies that expire at the end of a browser session; they are erased when users close their browsers.
- **Persistent cookies:** These cookies remain on users' devices for a set duration (from some days to several years) unless they are manually deleted by the user. You can find a detailed description of how to delete cookies in the Cookie Policy section “How can you manage your cookie preferences?”

### By cookie purpose:

- **Essential (strictly necessary) cookies:** These cookies are indispensable for maintaining the fundamental functionality of our Websites, so they are set to users’ devices without users’ explicit consent. Essential cookies are necessary to provide our Services and ensure Websites’ features (including the ability to remember your cookie consent preferences) and security. They help us:
  - Enable you to move around our Websites and use their features.
  - Enable you to access and use the Services.
  - Detect and prevent fraud, as well as enhance trust and safety measures of our Websites.
  
  For example, we use essential cookies to maintain a record of your cookie preferences and to safeguard the security of our Websites and your sessions (cookies such as _cfruid, rc::c, cf_bm). Some of these cookies are created by our service providers (e.g., Cloudflare).
<!-- do we have any? -->
- **Functionality cookies:** These cookies are used to enhance user experience by remembering information you have entered or choices you made on the Websites, so the next time you visit, you won't have to set them again. They also enable Websites’ functionalities.

  Please be aware that if you disable functionality cookies, you will not be able to access some functionalities of our Websites. For example, you won't be able to see the chat widget, which provides real-time assistance and support on our Websites.

- **Analytics cookies:** These cookies collect information about how you use our Websites, for instance, which pages you visit most often, and if you receive error messages from those pages. They allow us to make improvements to our Websites and analyze their performance. These cookies provide us with aggregated statistical information such as the number of page visits, page load speeds, and how long a user spends on a particular page. Analytics cookies help us to gain a better understanding of how you navigate through and interact with the Websites and Services, and to improve their operational features.

- **Advertising cookies:** These cookies record your visit to our Websites, other pages you have visited, and the links you have clicked. These cookies are placed by us or third-party advertising platforms or networks to make our Websites more relevant to your interests, deliver ads, and track ad performance. We use advertising cookies to:
  - Provide you with customized advertisements (on our Services, in emails, on third-party Websites, etc.).
  - Display content, such as advertisements, that is more relevant to your interests.
  - Measure and manage our marketing efforts.

  Advertising cookies include social media cookies. These cookies enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Websites through third-party social networking and other Websites.

## Third-Party Service Providers

We use third-party cookies that assist us in various ways. Some of them are essential, while others serve other purposes. For example, they help us with load balancing, defend against bots, and identify potential security and performance issues. They also optimize product features, gain insights into product usage to enhance functionality and overall user experience, and evaluate and refine our campaigns and communications with you.

The specific tools we use may vary depending on the Websites you visit, the features you access, and/or the operating system of your device. Please note that third-party service providers we engage may change over time and may vary by specific website. Third-party service providers we currently use include:
