## FAQ

Follow the steps outlined in our account recovery guide to regain access to your account number.

**Do you offer discounts or have sales?**  
We do not offer sales. However, we provide a 10% discount on payments made with accepted cryptocurrencies due to lower fees and administrative costs. For more details, visit our [pricing page](#).

Log in to the Account Status page on our website to view your account information and payment status.

**Do you offer a money-back guarantee?**  
Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, except for cash and cryptocurrency payments due to anti-money laundering regulations. For refund instructions, please refer to our [refund policy](#).

**I have paid but can't connect!**  
If you receive a message indicating that your account has expired, it may be due to payment processing issues. Check the status of your payment through your PayPal account if applicable, as PayPal can sometimes delay transaction updates. For cryptocurrency payments, ensure the transaction has been confirmed. Bank wire payments may take 1â€“2 business days to process.

As a consumer retailer, we do not offer VAT-exempt purchases for business accounts.

**Can I purchase more devices for my account? I have reached the five-device limit.**  
We cannot add more devices to a single account. You may either create a second account or install CicadaVPN on a router with OpenVPN or WireGuard to cover all devices on your local network.

**How do I delete my account?**  
To request account deletion, please email us at [support@cicadavpn.com](mailto:support@cicadavpn.com).

**How do I log in on my other devices? The CicadaVPN app says I need to pay again?**  
1. On the device with an active CicadaVPN account, tap the account button in the top right corner, then tap the eye icon to view your account number.
2. On your other devices, log out of the CicadaVPN app if you are already logged in. Then, log in using the account number you obtained from your first device.
